# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The aim of this project was to refactor a webpages code to make the code more efficient whilst keeping the web page looking idential.

I built this project as it was an interesting way to look at how HTML and CSS function together as working unit.
I helped me further understand the way in which HTML format and CSS work and combine.
